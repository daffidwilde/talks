Henry Wilde is a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Cardiff University under the
supervision of Dr Jonathan Gillard (who is on a part-time secondment at ONS) and
Dr Vincent Knight. His primary research is concerned with understanding the
causes and perpetuating factors of cost variation in the National Health
Service. Through his work, Henry has developed a keen interest in the areas of
machine learning, software development, and game theory.

Abstract
--------
This talk will introduce a new approach to learning the performance of an
algorithm through evolution. Classically, algorithms are compared on a finite
number of existing benchmark data sets based on some fixed metric, and the
algorithm(s) with the optimal metric value are chosen to be the 'best
performing'. The speaker instead aims to gain a richer picture of an algorithm's
performance by generating artificial data through an evolutionary algorithm, the
purpose of which is to create populations of data sets for which a particular
algorithm performs well. These data sets can be studied to learn as to what
attributes lead to a particular progress of a given algorithm. The talk will
conclude with a number of use cases for the proposed method including simple
optimisation and the simulation of existing data sets.
